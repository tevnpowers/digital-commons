					<p><strong>Celeste</strong> is an abolitionist geographer who employs critical qualitative and mapping methods at the intersections of racial, economic, gender, and disability justice work. She works to generate evidence for more livable and equitable geographies by connecting historical narratives, contemporary data, and imaginative visions rooted in experiences of systematically oppressed people.</p>
					<p>Celeste wrote the award-winning book <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/how-to-lose-the-hounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>How to Lose the Hounds: Maroon Geographies and a World beyond Policing</i></a> (Duke University Press, 2023) exploring marronage—the practice of flight from and placemaking beyond slavery—as a guide to police abolition. She also co-created the <a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/news/covid-and-cages-graduate-center-researchers-map-how-prisons-responded-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID-19 and Cages Mapping Project</a>, an interactive map depicting how US states responded to the first wave of COVID-19, and helped lead the <a href="https://www.downnorthfoundation.org/growing-freedom-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Growing Freedom Project</a>, a partnership with the Down North Foundation to generate evidence-based solutions for food justice among Black working-class and formerly and currently incarcerated Philadelphia residents.</p>
